This site is intended to function as a sort of online resume or catalog for projects my friend, Jordan, has done. There is a simple home page with navigation options to his art/DIYs, his re-worked clothes, and his photo portfolio. I also linked his Instagram and Tiktok so users have the option to see more content from him or get in contact with him.
